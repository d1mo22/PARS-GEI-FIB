# A - Algorismia (Algorithmics)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit mandatory course in the Computer Science specialization that explores algorithms, their properties and efficiency. The course builds on foundational knowledge to introduce advanced algorithmic design techniques and data structures.

### Main Topics
- **Algorithmic Foundations**: Asymptotic notation, divide-and-conquer, graph algorithms
- **Greedy Methods**: Dijkstra's algorithm, minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim)
- **Dynamic Programming**: Floyd-Warshall, edit distance, knapsack problems
- **Network Flows**: Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, max-flow/min-cut theorem
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Fibonacci heaps, bloom filters, metric structures

### Learning Objectives
- Apply greedy algorithms to solve optimization problems
- Use dynamic programming for complex computational challenges
- Understand network flow algorithms and their applications
- Leverage randomization in algorithm design
- Implement advanced data structures for specialized problems
