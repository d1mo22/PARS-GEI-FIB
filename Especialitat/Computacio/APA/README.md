# APA - Aprenentatge Automatic (Machine Learning)

## About the Subject

This subject focuses on developing theories, techniques, and algorithms enabling systems to modify their behavior through inductive inference from incomplete data. It bridges statistics, artificial intelligence, programming, and optimization.

### Main Topics

**Supervised Learning:**
- Linear methods (regression, LDA, logistic regression)
- Nonlinear approaches (neural networks, SVMs, decision trees)
- Dimensionality reduction techniques

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- Clustering algorithms (k-means, EM)

**Reinforcement Learning:**
- Markov processes and temporal difference methods

**Theoretical Foundations:**
- Bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting/underfitting, model selection

### Learning Objectives
- Formulate machine learning problems from data
- Organize solution workflows and defend technical choices
- Interpret results and apply key techniques
- Implement algorithms using Python
