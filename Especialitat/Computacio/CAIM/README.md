# CAIM - Cerca i Analisi d'Informacio Massiva (Massive Information Search and Analysis)

## About the Subject

This course addresses the challenges of organizing and retrieving information from massive digital collections. Students learn techniques to help users find what they seek efficiently within large-scale datasets and web environments.

### Main Topics
- **Information Retrieval Fundamentals**: Boolean, vector, and semantic indexing models
- **Implementation**: Inverted files, index compression, tools like Lucene/Elasticsearch
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measuring recall, precision, and relevance feedback
- **Web Search**: PageRank algorithm and web crawler architecture
- **Scalable Systems**: Distributed computing approaches (MapReduce) for massive datasets
- **Network Analysis**: Detecting communities, influential nodes, and graph properties
- **Practical Applications**: Recommendation systems, search optimization, data mining

### Learning Objectives
- Understand information retrieval problems, particularly for textual data
- Recognize how information organization impacts search effectiveness
- Comprehend web architecture, crawlers, and search mechanisms
- Analyze complex network structures and their characteristics
- Apply information extraction techniques
- Implement recovery algorithms and assess system effectiveness
