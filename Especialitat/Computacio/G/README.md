# G - Grafics (Graphics)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit mandatory course focusing on interactive 3D visualization and realistic scene rendering. Students develop graphics applications using C++, OpenGL, and GLSL.

### Main Topics
- **Visualization fundamentals**: Light emission, reflection, transmission; diffuse and specular behavior
- **Graphics pipeline**: Geometric transformations, vertex processing, rasterization, fragment operations
- **Advanced rendering**: Shader development, 2D texturing, shadow mapping, environment mapping
- **Global illumination**: Radiometry basics, BSDF, rendering equations, ray-tracing variants
- **3D interaction**: Object selection, manipulation, camera navigation
- **Spatial data structures**: Efficiency optimization for ray-tracing

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the complete projection visualization process
- Master local and global illumination models
- Develop shader programs in GLSL
- Implement 3D scene interaction techniques
- Create algorithms for realistic effects: textures, shadows, reflections, transparency
- Implement ray-tracing and ray-geometry intersection methods
