# IA - Intel·ligencia Artificial (Artificial Intelligence)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit compulsory specialization course providing a general vision of artificial intelligence, presenting the types of problems that can be resolved, theoretical foundations, basic techniques and how to apply them.

### Main Topics
- **Problem-solving**: Search algorithms, constraint satisfaction, genetic algorithms
- **Knowledge representation**: Ontologies, reasoning systems, handling uncertainty
- **Planning**: Linear and hierarchical planning in deterministic/stochastic environments
- **Machine learning**: Decision trees, artificial neural networks, learning types
- **Applications**: Data mining, recommendation systems, natural language processing, computer vision, multi-agent systems

### Learning Objectives
- Understand AI fundamentals and problem-solving approaches
- Learn knowledge representation and reasoning techniques
- Master planning and machine learning methods
- Analyze which AI techniques suit different problems
- Apply machine learning to practical scenarios
