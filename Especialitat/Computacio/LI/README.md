# LI - Logica a la Informatica (Logic in Computer Science)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit mandatory course in the Computer Science specialization that provides a solid foundation of logic for computer scientists. The course explores how logic applies across databases, computational complexity, programming languages, AI, and system verification.

### Main Topics
- **Propositional Logic**: Formulas, truth tables, satisfiability, normal forms
- **Deduction Methods**: DPLL algorithm, resolution, SAT solvers
- **First-Order Logic**: Quantifiers, unification, Skolemization
- **Logical Programming**: Prolog, SLD resolution, backtracking
- **Constraint Programming**: CLP(X), resource allocation, scheduling problems

### Learning Objectives
- Understand logic fundamentals: syntax (formulas) and semantics (interpretations)
- Master propositional and first-order logics with practical applications
- Apply deduction methods like Davis-Putnam and resolution
- Use SAT solvers and logical programming (Prolog) for real problems
- Express NP-complete problems as satisfiability challenges
- Implement constraint logic programming for optimization
