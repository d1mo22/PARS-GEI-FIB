# TC - Teoria de la Computacio (Theory of Computation)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit mandatory specialization course providing methods of description and treatment of languages with applications in compilers, graphics, and algorithm design.

### Main Topics
- **Formal Languages & Automata**: Finite automata, regular expressions, context-free grammars, pushdown automata
- **Computability Theory**: Turing machines, decidability, semi-decidability, and computability
- **Undecidability**: Proving non-regular and non-context-free properties; demonstrating undecidability through reductions
- **Complexity Theory**: P, NP, and coNP classes; polynomial-time reductions; NP-completeness

### Learning Objectives
- Classify problems by computational complexity (regular, context-free, polynomial, exponential, decidable, semidecidable)
- Describe languages using formal systems like automata and context-free grammars
- Understand computational capabilities and limits
- Develop critical reasoning and rigorous argumentation skills
