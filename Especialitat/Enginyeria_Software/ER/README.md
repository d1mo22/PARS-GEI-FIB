## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit mandatory course for the Information Systems specialization that focuses on determining what software systems should be built. As noted, "the most difficult task in constructing an information system is determining which system to construct."

### Main Topics
- Requirements engineering fundamentals and activities
- Stakeholder analysis and objective definition
- System context, boundaries, and use case modeling
- Requirements determination methods and conflict resolution
- Conceptual modeling (structural and behavioral schemas)
- Traceability and consistency across artifacts
- Validation and documentation practices

### Learning Objectives
- Define project objectives and identify stakeholders
- Create use cases and specify functional/non-functional requirements
- Perform satisfaction argumentation linking requirements to goals
- Develop conceptual schemas from requirements
- Validate specifications through inspection methods
