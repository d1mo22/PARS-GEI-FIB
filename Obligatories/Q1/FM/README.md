# FM - Fonaments Matematics (Mathematical Foundations)

## About the Subject

This is a 7.5-credit mandatory course that covers two main areas: mathematical logic and discrete mathematics, with a focus on number theory.

### Main Topics
- **Logic & Foundational Concepts**: Propositions, predicate logic, set theory, relations, equivalence classes, functions
- **Number Theory**: Divisibility, prime numbers, Euclidean algorithm, GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic, RSA cryptography

### Learning Objectives
- Understand precise mathematical language for scientific communication
- Master mathematical proofs and their various types
- Apply the induction principle for proving properties
- Understand integer divisibility and the Euclidean algorithm
- Apply congruences in computational applications
