# PRO1 - Programacio I (Programming I)

## About the Subject

This is a 7.5-credit foundational programming course teaching imperative language fundamentals using C++. Students learn basic concepts and techniques for building programs in imperative languages.

### Main Topics
- **Basics**: Variables, expressions, data types, C++ instructions
- **Control Flow**: Iteration with for/while loops, conditionals
- **Modular Programming**: Functions, procedures, scope, parameters
- **Algorithms**: Traversal, searching, recursion, sorting (insertion, selection, mergesort, quicksort), binary search
- **Data Structures**: One and multidimensional arrays

### Learning Objectives
- Master core programming constructs
- Apply top-down design methodology
- Implement fundamental algorithms including binary search and sorting
- Work with arrays and basic data structures
