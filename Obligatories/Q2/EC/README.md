# EC - Estructura de Computadors (Computer Structure)

## About the Subject

This is a 7.5-credit mandatory course exploring the basic organization of computers supporting high-level programming languages, focusing on data types and control statements.

### Main Topics
- **Introduction**: Computer hierarchy, performance metrics
- **Assembly & Data Types**: MIPS fundamentals, number representation
- **Program Translation**: Logic operations, control flow, subroutines
- **Arrays & Matrices**: Storage and sequential access
- **Arithmetic**: Integer and IEEE754 floating-point operations
- **Cache Memory**: Direct mapping, associativity, multi-level caches
- **Virtual Memory**: Address translation, TLB management
- **Exceptions/Interrupts**: Hardware support and handling
