# M1 - Matematiques I (Mathematics I)

## About the Subject

This is a 7.5-credit mandatory course that continues developing mathematical reasoning while introducing two essential topics for computer engineers: graph theory and linear algebra.

### Main Topics
- **Graph Theory**: Basic graph concepts, adjacency/incidence matrices, paths, connectivity, Eulerian/Hamiltonian graphs, trees and spanning trees
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrices, systems of linear equations, vector spaces/subspaces, linear applications, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalization

### Learning Objectives
- Develop capacity for critical, logical and mathematical reasoning
- Solve problems through abstract thinking and practical problem-solving
- Master graph theory concepts and algorithms
- Apply linear algebra techniques in computational contexts
