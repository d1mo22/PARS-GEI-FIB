# PRO2 - Programacio II (Programming II)

## About the Subject

This 7.5-credit course introduces modular design and object-oriented programming using C++. Students learn linear data structures (stacks, queues, lists) and tree structures, with emphasis on iterative and recursive algorithm design.

### Main Topics
- Linear data structures (stacks, queues, lists, maps, sets)
- Tree-based data structures (binary trees)
- Loop invariants and iterative program correctness
- Recursive design and function generalization
- Modular and object-oriented design principles
- Pointer-based implementations and dynamic memory

### Learning Objectives
- Design independent data classes with clear separation between specification and implementation
- Implement linked data structures using pointers
- Analyze algorithm correctness and efficiency
- Design modular C++ programs
