# CI - Interficies de Computadors (Computer Interfaces)

## About the Subject

This 6-credit mandatory course examines the computer's input/output system in depth, focusing on hardware-software interfaces and their practical implementation.

### Main Topics
- Microcomputer architecture and instruction execution pipelines
- Input/output port structures and control mechanisms
- Interrupt handling and service routines
- Timer/counter functionality for pulse and signal generation
- Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion interfaces
- Serial communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, USB)
- Bus hierarchies and Direct Memory Access (DMA) operations

### Learning Objectives
- Program microcontroller subsystems
- Manage temporal constraints
- Resolve hardware-software tradeoffs
- Interpret technical documentation
- Bridge theoretical principles with embedded systems implementation
