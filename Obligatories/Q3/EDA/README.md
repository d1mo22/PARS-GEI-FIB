# EDA - Estructures de Dades i Algorismes (Data Structures and Algorithms)

## About the Subject

This 6-credit mandatory course introduces algorithm efficiency analysis and foundational data structures. Students learn to evaluate computational complexity using asymptotic notation, then study classic algorithms and implementations.

### Main Topics
- Algorithm analysis and asymptotic notation
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms (mergesort, quicksort, matrix multiplication)
- Dictionary implementations (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, balanced trees)
- Priority queues and heaps
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Prim)
- Backtracking and exhaustive search
- Introduction to P, NP, and NP-completeness

### Learning Objectives
- Analyze algorithm cost across best, average, and worst cases
- Design solutions using divide-and-conquer techniques
- Implement dictionary structures (hash tables, BSTs, AVL trees)
- Build graph algorithms
- Understand computational limits through NP-completeness theory
