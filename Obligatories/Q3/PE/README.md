# PE - Probabilitat i Estadistica (Probability and Statistics)

## About the Subject

This 6-credit mandatory course teaches students to work with random phenomena, model uncertainty, and quantify the predictive capacity of forecasts.

### Main Topics
- **Probability & Random Variables**: Probability calculations, conditional/joint probabilities, Bayes' theorem, distributions, expected values, variance
- **Probabilistic Models**: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Exponential distributions, Central Limit Theorem
- **Statistical Foundations**: Population sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, parameter estimation
- **Statistical Models & Prediction**: Linear modeling, assumption validation, comparative studies

### Learning Objectives
- Solve mathematical problems involving probability
- Apply statistical techniques for decision-making
- Think critically about uncertainty in computing systems
- Design and analyze real studies using R
