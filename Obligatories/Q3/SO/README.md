# SO - Sistemes Operatius (Operating Systems)

## About the Subject

This 6-credit mandatory course examines operating systems from three perspectives: services offered to users/programs, internal kernel design elements, and how concurrent execution affects system performance.

### Main Topics
- **Introduction to Operating Systems**: Functions, services, resource management
- **Process Management**: Process lifecycle, scheduling, context switching, concurrency, signals
- **Memory Management**: Virtual memory, address translation, protection mechanisms
- **Input/Output Management**: Device types, device independence, file systems, i-nodes
- **Thread Execution**: Thread abstractions and management structures

### Learning Objectives
- Understand OS functions and resource management (abstraction, virtualization, security, efficiency)
- Comprehend internal OS mechanisms through data structures and algorithms
- Grasp interactions between hardware, system libraries, and user programs
- Apply evaluation metrics to assess system quality and performance
