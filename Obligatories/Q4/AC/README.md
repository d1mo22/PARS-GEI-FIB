# AC - Arquitectura de Computadors (Computer Architecture)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit compulsory course teaching how modern computers function and the fundamentals of computer design and evaluation, emphasizing the impact of design decisions on performance, power consumption, energy use, cost and reliability.

### Main Topics
- Memory hierarchy and optimization techniques
- Storage systems and data reliability
- Instruction set architecture (ISA) and RISC-CISC paradigms
- Processor parallelism techniques (pipelining, superscalar, VLIW, vectorization, multithreading, multiprocessors)
- Hardware/software interaction for performance optimization

### Learning Objectives
- Translate high-level code to assembly (IA32) and link with C using Linux ABI
- Describe memory hierarchy components and performance improvements
- Evaluate system reliability using error detection/correction mechanisms
- Assess code performance considering memory, storage, ISA, and processor design
- Evaluate power consumption and energy impact on applications
- Apply optimization techniques for code performance and efficiency
