	\class Box
	\brief The %Box class represents an axis-aligned box in 3D space (usually a bounding box).  
	
	The Box class represents a box in 3D space through its (min, max) corners.
	This class is suitable for representing axis-aligned boxes (but not oriented boxes).
	A typical use is for representing the bounding box of an object or group of objects.
