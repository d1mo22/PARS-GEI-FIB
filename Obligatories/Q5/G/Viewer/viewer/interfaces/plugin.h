    /class Plugin
    /brief The Plugin class is the base class for all plugins.

    All plugins you will have to implement must derive from this class. 

    All methods have a default implementation (do nothing), so each plugin can override
    only those methods needed to provide the intended functionality. 

    An <em> Effect Plugin </em> might override preFrame() and postFrame() methods
    to modify the OpenGL state before and after the scene is rendered (for example, to load shaders
    or to enable alphablending) and to draw additional content (for example, the frame rate).

    A <em> Draw Plugin </em> might override the drawScene() method, which is in charge of drawing
    all the objects forming the scene by issuing OpenGL rendering commands. 

    An <em> Action Plugin </em> might override user input methods such as keyPressEvent(), mouseMoveEvent()
    to allow for some interaction: camera control, object selection...

    A <em> Render Plugin </em> should override paintGL(). The main purpose is to implement techniques
    requiring multiple rendering passes, for example, shadow mapping.

    so you should not draw anything here. For drawing additional primitives override the 
    postFrame() method instead.

    the frame rate or a wireframe box around the selected object).

    of the current <em> Draw Plugin </em>:
    @code

        if (drawPlugin()) drawPlugin()->drawScene();
        return true;
    @endcode
    If you override paintGL(), you must always return true so that the application
    knows it has been repainted successfully. 
    */
    virtual bool paintGL() {return false;}

    // methods for "draw" plugins
    /*!
    This method is intended to be involked by any plugin willing to draw the scene. 
    For example, a plugin overriding paintGL().
    If you override drawScene(), you must always return true so that the application
    knows the scene has been drawn successfully. 
    The GLWidget class keeps track of the plugin overriding this method.
    Using legacy code, a minimal implementation could be:
    @code
        bool MyPluginExample::drawScene()
        {
            for (unsigned int i=0; i<scene()->objects().size(); ++i)

                        const Point& p = obj.vertices()[face.vertexIndex(v)].coord();
                        glVertex3f(p.x(), p.y(), p.z());
                    }
