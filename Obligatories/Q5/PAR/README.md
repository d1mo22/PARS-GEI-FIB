# PAR - Paral·lelisme (Parallelism)

## About the Subject

This 6-credit mandatory course teaches fundamental parallel programming concepts essential for modern multi-core computing architectures.

### Main Topics
- **Introduction & Motivation**: Necessity of parallelism, concurrency issues (deadlock, data races)
- **Performance Analysis**: Metrics like speedup, scalability; visualization tools (Paraver, Tareador)
- **Shared-Memory Programming**: OpenMP implementation for threads and task management
- **Parallel Architectures**: Instruction-level, data-level, and thread-level parallelism; multiprocessor systems
- **Task Decomposition**: Granularity analysis, dependency identification, iterative vs. divide-and-conquer patterns
- **Data Decomposition**: Geometric and recursive approaches; data locality in shared-memory systems

### Learning Objectives
- Formulate performance models and measure execution efficiency
- Implement OpenMP parallel programs
- Identify appropriate decomposition strategies
- Apply synchronization techniques
- Optimize parallel code fragments
