# MD - Mineria de Dades (Data Mining)

## About the Subject

This optional 6-credit course teaches students how to convert data into knowledge for decision-making through the central phase of knowledge discovery from databases (KDD). It combines statistics, machine learning, database techniques, and decision systems.

### Main Topics
- Data visualization and dimensionality reduction
- Clustering methods (partitioning, hierarchical, expectation-maximization)
- Predictive methods (regression, logistic regression, neural networks)
- Decision trees (CART)
- Association rule generation (Apriori, Eclat)
- Bayesian methods and discriminant analysis
- Data preprocessing and validation protocols
- Ensemble methods (bagging)

### Learning Objectives
- Identify main problem types in data mining
- Evaluate data quality and preprocessing needs
- Select appropriate statistical/machine learning techniques
- Implement learning algorithms
- Assess result quality
- Present findings professionally
