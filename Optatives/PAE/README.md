## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit optional course for 4th-year Computer Engineering students that applies project-based learning to real industry challenges. Students work in groups of 4, mentored by companies, to develop innovative solutions to engineering problems.

### Methodology

The course follows three phases:

1. **Creative & System Thinking**: Students analyze company-proposed challenges and develop comprehensive, multi-disciplinary solutions using design-thinking methodology.

2. **Engineering Design**: Groups create formal project specifications including objectives, work packages, timelines, and deliverables, negotiated with the company.

3. **Team Development & Defense**: Students implement solutions through guided work sessions, technical consultations, company meetings, and culminate in formal presentations.

### Learning Objectives
- Define and plan feasible projects with appropriate scope
- Apply curriculum knowledge to design and implement engineering solutions
- Select suitable technologies based on project requirements
- Present and defend projects orally with supporting documentation
