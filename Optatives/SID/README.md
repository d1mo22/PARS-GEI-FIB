# SID - Sistemes Intel·ligents Distribuits (Distributed Intelligent Systems)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit optional course that combines theoretical foundations with practical laboratory work in distributed intelligent systems. It integrates mathematical, computational, and hands-on components using real hardware and simulation platforms.

### Main Topics
- Intelligent agent architectures and rationality
- Logic-based reasoning (BDI framework, modal logic)
- Utility-driven decision-making (MDPs, POMDPs)
- Reinforcement learning algorithms
- Game theory (Nash equilibrium, coalitions, social choice)
- Multi-agent cooperation and negotiation
- Competitive game-solving approaches
- Mechanism design and auctions
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
- Social and ethical dimensions of autonomous systems

### Learning Objectives
- Understand distributed artificial intelligence concepts and multi-agent systems
- Design goal-oriented and utility-driven intelligent agents
- Apply reinforcement learning techniques for agent training
- Master game theory concepts and multi-agent coordination
- Implement cooperation and competition mechanisms
- Explore mechanism design and ethical implications of autonomous AI systems
