# VC - Visio per Computador (Computer Vision)

## About the Subject

This is a 6-credit optional course focusing on extracting and analyzing information from images and image sequences. Applications span from face recognition to medical diagnostics, object detection, robotic guidance, and autonomous driving.

### Main Topics
- **Fundamentals**: Digital image properties, color spaces, discretization
- **Processing**: Filtering, edge detection, morphological operators
- **Segmentation**: Region-based and contour-based techniques
- **Descriptors**: Shape and feature characterization with invariance properties
- **Recognition**: Classification methods (Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, PCA)
- **Local Features**: SIFT, Harris detectors, Haar features, Viola-Jones algorithm
- **Motion Analysis**: Optical flow, object tracking, motion detection

### Learning Objectives
- Analyze, design, program and evaluate image analysis methods
- Work with temporal response constraints, reliability, and cost requirements
- Apply computer vision techniques to real-world problems
- Implement feature detection and classification algorithms
